    <string name="app_info_text">Welcome to my bootcamp - competition Pokemon Map!\n \n
    It has map with location, that can be saved on list via button or map-click,
    it has real - time database to store saved location online,
    user can move and delete items on list via gestures - database keeps order information,
     images available on add-place screen are downloaded from REST API that is (almost) up to date and… there is still a lot of bugs to fix.\n \n
        But I hope you enjoy it as I did writing this little thing.\n \n
        Best Regards!
